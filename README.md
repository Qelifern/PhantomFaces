# PhantomFaces
This mod is a recreation/remake of the Phantomfaces from Ellpeck's Actually Additions.

As the mod is missing the block placer and breaker there are no phantomfaces for those blocks.

This was created to serve as a temporary replacement mod for those who want to use Ellpeck's phantomfaces in 1.16.4 while Ellpeck is updating Actually Additions.

Recipes are changed, view them with JEI.

This mod is open source, and may be modified and used in any modpack.
